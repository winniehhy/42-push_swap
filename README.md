## Pushswap
A Sorting Project is designed to sort a list of integers using two stacks and a series of operations.
The goal is to find the smallest sequence of operations needed to sort the integers. This project I uses the Turk sort method, which I learned through this article.

Features
- Sorts a list of integers using two stacks.
- Calculates the smallest sequence of operations needed to sort the integers.
- Displays the sequence of operations on the standard output.
- push the large sequence integer to stack B
- Rearrange in stack B , and push back to stack A
